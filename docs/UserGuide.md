> * The words that are in `UPPER_CASE` represents the parameters that the users are required to input
> e.g. `delete INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 1`.
> * Commands such as `help`, `list` and `bye` do not require additional parameters. Hence, any extra parameters will be ignored.
