> e.g. `delete INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 1`.
> * Commands such as `help` and `bye` do not require additional parameters. Hence, any extra parameters will be ignored. 
> e.g. `help 123` will just be intepreted as `help`.
> * Words that are in square brackets such as `[/tag TAG]` indicates that it is
> optional to include in the command.
> * Users should not use any `/` into their input descriptions unless using for input command format.
