The app offers search, filtering, and currency exchange features, ensuring a smooth travel planning experience.


### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project. 

* New Feature: Added the ability to save existing list information into a text file.
  * What it does: Allows the user to save their existing travel activity plans into a text file so that it can be
  reloaded later on.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because after a user inputs a certain travel plan, 
  they would want to be able to come back and update the list anytime they want.
  * Highlights: This feature needs to be updated everytime a new feature is added into the project.

* New Feature: Handled input parsing for the chatbot.
  * What it does: The parser class handles all the input made by the user into the chatbot an accurately parses the
  command to execute the appropriate tasks.
  * Justification: This feature ensures that all command features implemented by the team is handled properly and the 
  appropriate output is produced
  * Highlights: This feature needs to be updated everytime a new feature is added into the project.

* System testings: Tested most features to ensure that all major bugs are squashed.
  * What is done: Everytime a new feature is added, ensure that the feature works well with all other existing features
  and any possible bugs and regressions that may happen.
  * Justification: This project has multiple features that require existing features to work together. Therefore, when
  a feature is added, changes need to be made on other features. This may lead to regressions which needs to be fixed.
  * Highlights: System testing affects existing commands and features and requires in-depth analysis of design 
  alternatives. As there are multiple features that have a relation with one another. (EG. Save feature needs to be
  updated to ensure that new features are saved)
