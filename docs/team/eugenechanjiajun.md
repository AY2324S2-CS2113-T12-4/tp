### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project. 

#### Added the ability to save existing list information into a text file.
  * What it does: Allows the user to save their existing travel activity plans into a text file so that it can be
  reloaded later on.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because after a user inputs a certain travel plan, 
  they would want to be able to come back and update the list anytime they want.

#### Handled input parsing for the chatbot.
  * What it does: The parser class handles all the input made by the user into the chatbot an accurately parses the
  command to execute the appropriate tasks.
