## Overview
Omnitravel is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) app that stores users travel plans for easy reference while travelling.
Users are able to store, edit and delete various types of travel plans such as Accommodation, Food and Landmark. 
Users can also associate small bits of information about their trip to their travel plans such as the purpose of the 
visit through the expense and tagging functions. Various lookup functions such as the findtag functions enable the user 
to quickly group and retrieve information.
