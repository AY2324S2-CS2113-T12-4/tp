## Design

### Architecture
![ArchitectureDiagram.png](ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The architecture diagram above describes the high level design of the OmniTravel app.

**Main components of the architecture**

`omnitravel` which consists of the class `OmniTravel` has the responsibility of launching the app and shutting down.
* When the app launches, it initializes the other components in the app.
* When it shuts down, it will also shut down the other components.

The main components of the system are as follows:
* `storage`: It reads data from the folder omni.txt and writes data to it.
* `parser`: It filters the commands and executes them.
* `travelactivitytypes`: It holds the data of the app in memory.
* `ui`: The UI of the app.
* `errorhandlers`: It handles all the exceptions and checks for any errors in the app.

### Storage component
The Storage component only consists of one class `FileSave`. 

The storage component,
* saves the data of the different travel activity types, including their tags, expenses, type and
description.
* it listens to the `omnitravel` component to know when to save and load the file from omni.txt into the app.
* it retrieves travel activity objects from the `travelactivitytype` component to save.

### Parser component
The parser component only consists of one class `Parser`. 

The parser component,
* handles all the command inputs by the user
  and carries out the appropriate actions depending on the command given.
* uses the `ui` component to print responses to the user
* sends commands to the `exchangerateapi` and `travelactivitytype` components to execute.
* receives data from the `omnitravel` component.


### TravelActivityTypes component

![TravelActivityTypeClassDiagram.png](TravelActivityTypeClassDiagram.png)

The TravelActivityTypes component consists of a few different classes:
* `Accommodation`: A subclass of travel activity related to accommodation
* `Food`: A subclass of travel activity related to food
* `Landmark`: A subclass of travel activity related to landmark
* `TravelActivtiy`: The parent class of `Accommodation`, `Food` and `Landmark`
* `TravelActivityList`: An array consisting of travel activity type objects

The `TravelActivityTypes` component,
* stores all the travel activity type objects in an array.
* listens to the `parser` component for any commands to execute.

### Ui component
The Ui component only consists of one class `Ui`.

The Ui component, 
* listens to the `omnitravel`, `parser` and `travelactivitytypes` component to print out
the responses to the user.
* contains all the responses to each of the user's input command
* takes in exceptions as parameters and prints out the error message.

### Errorhandlers component
![Errorhandlers.png](Errorhandler.png)

The Errorhandler component consists of two classes `CheckParameters` and `OmniException`.
`OmniException` is a subclass of the parent class `Exception`.

The Errorhandler component,
* checks the parameters of the commands given by the user.
* handles all the exceptions and errors in the app.
* keeps a reference to `ui` component to print error messages.

## Implementation

### Save feature

The save feature is facilitated by `FileSave`. It makes calls to the subclasses `Accommodation`, `Food` and `Landmark`
which are subclasses of the `TravelActivity` class to add each activity saved in the text file.

`addTravelActivity` is called everytime there is a valid-stored data in the text file that is read to upload the
activity back into the array list.

Step 1. When the user launches the app for the first time, it will check if the text file `omni.txt` exist.

Step 2. Once it is found that the text file exists, the `readFile()` method will call `loadFileContents(list)`.

Step 3. In the `loadFileContents(list)`, `Scanner(f)` would read the text file line by line and insert each line into
the respective activity types and its contents with `/` as the delimiter.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the save file feature is being implemented when the user re-enters the chatbot
after using the bye command.

![img.png](img.png)

The above sequence diagram shows how existing save text files will be reloaded back into Omnibots array list to act as
a form of save feature when the user exits the bot. 

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

The above class diagram shows the methods and the respective input and return types that the FileSave class contains. It
also shows the classes called during the file load sequence.

### Update feature

The update feature is mainly carried out by `TravelActivityList`. It stores objects with class `TravelActivity`in an array called `travelActivities`
and each `TravelActivity` class object contains a date and duration. The `TravelAcivityList` also contains the following method:
* `TravelActivityList#updateTravelActivity(travelActivityNumber, date, duration)`-- Updates the date and duration of the specified object of `TravelActivity` class type.

Step 1. When the user launches the app for the first time, there will be no objects of type `TravelActivity` in `travelActivities`.
Thus, any attempts to call the command `update INDEX`
will result in an output telling the user that no travel activity can be found.

Step 2. After the user has added new travel activities into the `travelActivityList`, the user can execute
`update 1 /date 2020-12-20 /duration 2hours` command to update the date and duration of the first travel activity
in the travel activity list. The `update` command calls the `Parser#updateCommand(line, list)` which then calls the `TravelActivityList#updateTravelActivity(travelActivityNumber, date, duration)`
. 

Step 3. The method will then find the travel activity with the corresponding travel activity number in the `travelActivities` and then set the new date and duration
of that travel activity.

The class diagram below shows the main relationship between the classes in the update feature:
![UpdateFeatureClassDiagrma.png](UpdateFeatureClassDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows how an update operation goes through the parser component:
![img_1.png](img_1.png)

### Total Expense feature

The total expense feature is mainly carried out by `TravelActivityList`. It stores objects with class `TravelActivity`in an array called `travelActivities`
and each `TravelActivity` class object contains an expense associated with it. The `TravelAcivityList` also contains the following method:
* `TravelActivityList#totalExpense(type)`-- Returns the total expense of activities in the list with given type.

Step 1. When the user launched the app for the first time, there will be no objects of type `TravelActivity` in `travelActivities`.
Thus any attempts to call the command `total expense`
will result in an output of `0`.

Step 2. After the user has added new travel activities into the `travelActivityList`, the user can execute
`totalexpense [/type TYPE]` command to get the total expense for the activities in the list. The `total expense` command calls the  `Parser#totalExpenseCommand(line, list)` which then calls the `TravelActivityList#totalExpense(type)`.

Step 3. The method will loop through each activity in `travelActivities` and add up all the expenses for the given type. If no type is provided, it will default to TravelActivity type.

![totalexpense.png](totalexpense.png)

### Tag feature

The tag feature is implemented through the tagCommand method, which allows users to add tags to specific travel activities stored in the system.

The sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the user, the tagCommand method, the TravelActivityList instance, and the OmniException instance.

## Appendix: Requirements
## Product scope
### Target user profile
* Needs to manage multiple travel plans
* Prefers typing to clicking with mouse


### Value proposition
Tourists may have many plans during their holiday. Omnitravel aims to be a one-stop-shop for all travel plans.
Omnitravels stores the user's travel plans and enable them to quickly retrieve their travel plans using the search 
functions.
